# {#homoiconic}

[Homoiconicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity)

* the *homoiconic model* represents **data structures as programs**
* some subset of *active data* objects has **executable semantics**
  * can be executed in a data context, and
  * can modify parts of programs including itself in runtime
* **executable data** *must be implemented by an interpreter*
  * as an external entity
    * written in say Python and hidden as part of the homoiconic engine, or
  * written in the form of executable data:
    * some part of the homoiconic system can interpret other parts
